# TensorFlow Machine Learning with Financial, New York Times and Watson Data on IBM Power 8 systems

This solution presents an accessible, non-trivial example of machine learning with time series on IBM Power8 systems.This experiment will focus on the 'renewable energy' sector.
In this solution, we will:

- Obtain 'renewable energy' data from a number of financial markets (indexes and ETFs).
- Obtain from the New York Times articles related to renewable energies
- Use Watson to process the articles and extract meaningful data.
- Munge that data into a usable format and perform exploratory data analysis in order to explore and validate a premise.
- Use TensorFlow to build, train and evaluate a number of models for predicting what will happen in financial markets
