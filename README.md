# Evaluating predictability of financial markets using New York Times sentiments and market data.

*Read this in other languages: [한국어](README.ko.md).*

In this Code Pattern we will use a Jupyter notebook to showcase an
example of machine learning with time series on IBM Power8 systems. The
notebook will focus on evalulating the predictability of future
financial market values in the "renewable energy" sector by examining
related markets and sentiment detected in New York Times news articles.

When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:

* Extract and format structured data from various external sources.
* Extract and format unstructured data and use IBM Watson cognitive
services to extract data sentiment.
* Build and train Neural Networks.
* Display and share results in Jupyter notebooks.

The intended audience for this Code Pattern is application developers who need
to efficiently build powerful deep learning applications, but who may
not have an abundance of time or data science experience.

The **Welcome to IBM PowerAI Trial** page provides instructions for accessing the trial, as shown below. Alternatively, you will receive an email confirming your registration with similar instructions that you can follow to start the trial.

![](doc/source/images/welcomepage.jpg)

Summary of steps for starting the trial:

* Start a terminal session from your local machine and issue the following command where `{IP Address}` is the IP Address (or host name) shown on the welcome page (or in the confirmation email).
  ```sh
  ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 nimbix@{IP Address}
  ```

* Enter the password shown on the welcome page (or in the confirmation email) when prompted.

* From your local browser, go to the following URL to get started: http://localhost:8888/tree/.

## 2. Access and start the Jupyter notebook

Use git clone to download the example notebook and data with a single command.

* Get a new terminal window by clicking on the ```New``` pull-down and selecting ``Terminal``.

![](doc/source/images/powerai-notebook-terminal.png)

* Run the following command to clone the git repo:

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/IBM/powerai-notebook
```

![](doc/source/images/powerai-notebook-clone.png)

* Once done, you can exit the terminal and return to the notebook browser. Use the ``Files`` tab and click on ``powerai-notebook`` then ``notebooks`` and then ``Clean_Energy_Watson_V1.0.ipynb`` to open the notebook.

![](doc/source/images/powerai-notebook-open.png)

## 3. Run the notebook

When a notebook is executed, what is actually happening is that each code cell in
the notebook is executed, in order, from top to bottom.

Each code cell is selectable and is preceded by a tag in the left margin. The tag
format is `In [x]:`. Depending on the state of the notebook, the `x` can be:

* A blank, this indicates that the cell has never been executed.
* A number, this number represents the relative order this code step was executed.
* A `*`, this indicates that the cell is currently executing.

There are several ways to execute the code cells in your notebook:

* One cell at a time.
  * Select the cell, and then press the `Play` button in the toolbar.
* Batch mode, in sequential order.
  * From the `Cell` menu bar, there are several options available. For example, you
    can `Run All` cells in your notebook, or you can `Run All Below`, that will
    start executing from the first cell under the currently selected cell, and then
    continue executing all cells that follow.

Notes:

- Regarding cell `[4]`: For the Code Pattern we import already collected
stock market data. This can be done inside the notebook, but requires
access to private financial websites (such as Bloomberg), which requires
a subscription fee.

- Regarding cell `[5]`: In an effort to speed up the
notebook processing time, the New York Times data has already
been collected and stored in a JSON file, and is imported by the notebook.

- The Code Pattern is based on the original Google Cloud Platform example
documented at https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning-with-financial-time-series-data.
The difference between this "IBM Demo" and the original "Google Demo" is noted
in the following table:

## 4. Analyze the results

The result of running the notebook is a report which may be shared with or
without sharing the code. You can share the code for an audience that wants
to see how you came your conclusions. The text, code and output/charts are
combined in a single web page. For an audience that does not want to see
the code, you can share a web page that only shows text and output/charts.

The graphs and charts produced in this Code Pattern attempt to prove that the
closing value of the Nasdaq Clean Energy Index can be predicted by
examining various input sources, such as the New York Times and other
financial markets, both foreign and domestic. These markets include:

- Australian Clean Tech Index (asx_cti)
- Germany DAX (dax_eusdn)
- UK FTSE100 (ftse-eo100)
- UK Credit Suisse (n8wh)
- US First Trust Nasdaq Clean Edge ETF (qcln and cels)
- US S&P Global Clean Energy Index (icln and sp_gtced)
- US Equity Uncertainty Index (dei)

#### Collect Data

The notebook begins by collecting and formatting data:

* Collect and merge 3 years of stock market financial data.

* Collect 3 years of "green energy" articles from the New York
Times. This data is then feed into the Watson Natural Language Understanding
service to gather sentiment analysis - specifically by assigning a
relative positive or negative score to each article.

![](doc/source/images/sentiment-values.png)

#### Analyze Data

The notebook then utilizes EDA (exploratory data analysis) methods to
find correlations in the data. These findings include:

* Over a 3-year period, there is a correlation between all of the indexes.

![](doc/source/images/3-year-span.png)

* There is a correlation between current values of an index and lagged
values of the same index.

![](doc/source/images/correlation-data.png)

* There are 2 US indexes (qcln and icln) that correlate with the closing
values of other indexes available on the same day (i.e. non-US indexes).

![](doc/source/images/scatter-graph.png)

The final analysis from the EDA are as follows:
- The Australian Index close from the same day is a strong predictor
for the close of the Nasdaq Energy Index.
- European indices are a significant predictor for the close of the
Nasdaq Energy Index.
- Indices from previous days were not a good predictor for the Nasdaq
Energy Index.

#### Train and Test Data

After determining this correlation in the data, the notebook then
uses TensorFlow and the IBM PowerAI machine learning framework to train
and test the data.

After hundreds of thousands of iterations over the data using multiple
models, the notebook is able to achieve a 70% success rate for
predicting whether the Nasdaq Energy Index would close up or down on any
given day.

## 5. Save and share

### How to save your work:

Because this notebook is running temporarily on a Nimbix
Cloud server, the options to saving and sharing the notebook are limited.

Under the `File` menu, there are options to:

* `Download as...` will download the notebook to your local system.
* `Print Preview` will allow you to print the current state of the
  notebook.

## 6. End your trial

When you are done with your work, please cancel your subscription by issuing the following command in your ssh session or by visiting the `Manage` link on the **My Products and Services** page.

```sh
sudo poweroff --force
```
